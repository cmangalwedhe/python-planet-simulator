# Planet Simulation Project

## General Idea of Project
This is a project of mine, inspired by Tech With Tim, to create a planet simulation which shows the orbit of the 
four nearest planets to the sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars and to show how far they are away from the sun using real
astronomical values found on NASA's website.

### Modules Used
PyGame: Handled GUI and actual movement of the planets in the simulation including pause button.

### Credits:
[Video Used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTLPmUHTPqohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTLPmUHTPqo) - This video
inspired the project and gave me a good understanding of what I need to do and help expand my project.

[NASA Website to find values](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/jupiterfact.html)
Replace "jupiter" to which planet values you would like to see

For reference I used the following values in my code:
<li>Semimajor axis (10^6 km) [In Ratio (Jupiter/Earth Column) for radius of planet</li>
<li>Mass (10^24 kg) to find mass of the planet</li>
<li>Mean orbital velocity (km/s) [In Jupiter column]</li>
